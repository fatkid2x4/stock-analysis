# Module 2: Refactor VBA Challenge 

## Overview of Project

We were tasked with refactoring our module 2 "All Stocks Analysis" using the provided instructions on coding.  After proper application of the coding we should have a quicker run time then our original module.


## Results
First of all, I must say my original work on this module showed results over four seconds on both 2017 and 2018.  I could have cleaned that up for sure before I refactored with different coding.  

When I refactored my run times, even with my "extra" code was still 0.109375 for 2017 and 0.109375 for 2018 (see below).  The code I added to compute average daily volume and average return added about .6 seconds to each.  Obviously I could use some help there.  However, I did a record macro, copy and paste into the current macro, with little clean up.  So I guess that should be expected?

## Summary

This was very a very taxing exercise.  I would say it took me three times as long as the first module due to my lack of familiarity with VBA (and only a little more now) . Honestly, if my profession involves much VBA, I will run away. Okay maybe not.  I think it will all become much clearer after the many modules in front of us.
I did a lot of research from my notes, renewed my class module 3 times, looked up on-line how to best apply this code in VBA.  I finally was able to successfully deploy the macro after many changes, redo's, and moving things around.
I don't want to go back to VBA, especially after seeing Python.  I used to play with VBA.  Mostly recording macros and making adjustments.  I see I have a lot to learn.

## Added fun

Hope I am not in trouble for added some fun things along the way.  Like my extra coding and the addition of a clear screen macro and button.  I found myself constantly clear the screen trying to get the code right.  So the clear screen macro and button fit well into the class.


### Advantages of Refactoring Code in General

Very clearly, how you write the code makes a big difference in how the results come out.  If I were writing/editing very large code, i can see the importance of using the most efficient means to save space and time.


### Disadvantages of Refactoring Code in General
Can be very time consuming, frustrating, and I am sure often doesn't save enough time to refactor.  Also I could see myself refactoring and messing the code up.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I think I mostly answered this, but lack of knowing the codes and really not much in the way of intuition to VBA.  I have written a lot of advanced formulas in Excel and they seem a lot more intuitive then VBA.  I also made the mistake early on of having a macro that was working, but didn't save.  Made another change to it and then couldn't figure out what I did wrong.  Maybe in the future I should used Github for my save feature.  I look forward to Python and it appears more simple but it could be just as challenging.  Even in VBA i can look at the code and listen to someone interpret what it means, but in no way could I write it again.  I know it takes time and practice but still frustrating.
One last note is that I do like it a lot but difficult and with little experience.  I can see a lot of things happening, but figure there has to be a better way. Coding can be very fun.
